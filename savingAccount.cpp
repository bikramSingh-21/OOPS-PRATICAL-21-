/*Create class SavingsAccount. Use a static variable annualInterestRate to store the annual interest rate for all account holders. Each object of the class contains a private instance variable savingsBalance indicating the amount the saver currently has on deposit. Provide methodFor batches admitted in 2023-24 and 2024-25 onwards, Applicable from Academic Session 2024-25 calculateMonthlyInterest() to calculate the monthly interest by multiplying the savingsBalance by annualInterestRate divided by 12.This interest should be added tosavingsBalance. Provide a static method modifyInterestRate() that sets the annualInterestRate to a new value. Write a program to test class SavingsAccount. Instantiate two savingsAccount objects, saver1 and saver2, with balances of Rs2000.00 and Rs3000.00, respectively. Set annualInterestRate to 4%, then calculate the monthly interest and print the new balances for both savers. Then set the annualInterestRate to 5%, calculate the next monthâ€™s interest and print the
new balances for both savers*/
